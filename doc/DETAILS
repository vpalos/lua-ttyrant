    Lua-TTyrant

    TokyoTyrant API for Lua.
    Copyright (C)2010 by Valeriu Palos. All rights reserved.
    This library is under the MIT license (read doc/README).

--- Description ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Lua-ttyrant is a binding to the C API of the TokyoTyrant server (visit http://fallabs.com/) for the Lua
    programming language. I have seen several attempts on the net to build a TokyoTyrant library straight in
    Lua (implementing the tyrant/memcache protocol) but I feel that is an unnatural approach since Lua was
    especially designed to work *with* C and not to avoid it. Further more, by using the actual TokyoTyrant C
    API library this implementation is less likely to produce protocol errors or inconsistencies.

    The goal of lua-ttyrant is to be a stable, binary-safe and complete binding of the TokyoTyrant C API
    for both Lua and LuaJIT. At the time of this writing TokyoTyrant 1.1.41 was used as the reference API.

--- Prerequisites --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    To compile lua-ttyrant you will need the following progams compiled/installed on your system:

    1. GCC
    2. TokyoTyrant
    3. lua 5.1
    4. luarocks

    On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems you can install all of these by issuing the following command:

       $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libtokyotyrant-dev lua5.1 liblua5.1-0-dev luarocks

--- Install/Test ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The recommended way to install Lua-TTyrant is via the LuaRocks system:

    $ luarocks install lua-ttyrant
    
    However, as an alternative, you can do it manually like this:
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/valeriupalos/lua-ttyrant
    $ cd lua-ttyrant
    $ luarocks make
    
    If you want to install it system-wide just run the last command as root (i.e. sudo luarocks make).

    To run the set of tests you will first have to start two instances of ttserver: one for a regular (hash)
    database (on port 1978) and another for a table database (on port 1979), then run the test.lua script:

    $ ttserver -port 1978 /tmp/test.tch &
    $ ttserver -port 1979 /tmp/test.tct &
    $ lua test/test.lua

    At the end you can stop the tyrant instances and delete the generated files like this:

    $ killall ttserver
    $ rm -rf /tmp/test.*

--- Bugs -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I *really* like to keep my works bug-free but sometimes that is too much work for just one person. So I
    ask you to issue a ticket (https://github.com/valeriupalos/lua-ttyrant/issues) when you find any bugs or
    misfeature or if you simply have a suggestion. Thank you!

--- Documentation --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The lua-ttyrant library is a *binding* which means that it actually "exposes" the functions provided
    by the original C API into the Lua language. Therefore you only need to consult two resources in order
    to know how to use it:

    1. The TokyoTyrant API reference (http://fallabs.com/tokyotyrant/spex.html).
    2. The 'test/test.lua' file which contains test cases for every implemented API function.

    There are however, as the tests show, a few differences from the original API. These are outlined below:

    --> The functions tcrdbecode() and tcrdberrmsg() are not present in the binding; instead all functions
        that can fail, will return <nil, 'error string'> on failure (as is the usual for Lua).

    --> The functionality usually provided in C by the tcrdbmisc() function (i.e. bulk operations) is merged
        straight in the get(), put() and out() methods of the ttyrant class, all of which can act on a whole
        set of keys/values, given as a table or a list (see the test cases for examples).

    --> The function variants ending in '2' (for strings) make no sense in Lua since the values are always
        implicitly converted into strings.

    --> Since Lua makes no difference between integers and doubles, the functions tcrdbaddint() and
        tcrdbadddouble() are merged into the function(s) ttyrant:increment() and <table>:increment(). The
        same goes for tcrdbiterinit() and tcrdbiternext() which are merged into <any>:iterator(). Also, other
        functions were only used internally (e.g. tcrdbqryrescols()) since they have no meaning for Lua.

--- Changes --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    *** 2012-02-18 ***

    - Depreciated <any>:keys()
      The keys() iterator function is depreciated in favor of iterator().
      
    - Depreciated ttyrant:open()
      The ttyrant:open() function has moved in the ttyrant.hash namespace (to match ttyrant.table).
      
    - Depreciated <any>:open({ host = 'localhost', port = 1978 })
      Passing a table of values to the open() functions is now depreciated; use either of:
        - open("localhost:1978")
        - open("localhost", 1978)

    - Depreciated <query>:delete()
      Query objects are now garbage collected (the delete() method does nothing and is depreciated).
      
    - Depreciated <query>:search_*()
      Query methods search_get, search_out, search_count are depreciated in favor of 
      searchget, searchout, searchcount (i.e. without the underscores).
      
    - Marked tcrdbget3 as implemented since <hash>:get(<table>) alreadyd had the same functionality.
    
    - Extended <hash>:get() and <any>:out() to also accept associative tables beside simple arrays.
      Basically the table's string keys are considered in addition to the values of numeric keys.
      All the following calls do the exact same thing (the same applies to <any>:out()):
        - <hash>:get('key1', 'key2')                    -- list
        - <hash>:get{'key1', 'key2'}                    -- indexed table
        - <hash>:get{['key1'] = ..., ['key2'] = ...}    -- associative table
        - <hash>:get{['key1'] = ..., 'key2'}            -- combination
        
    - Changed <hash>:put(<table>) to ignore numeric (array index) keys (it is possible that this will break
      backward-compatibility but unlikely since this was a weird and useless "feature").
    
--- Status ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The library is *almost* complete meaning that there are several functions which are not yet implemented
    (i.e. the ones marked with *** TODO *** in the correlation listing below).
    
    The library is to be considered in *beta* state, though it is already quite stable, being actually used 
    in production environments for more than a year. If you require some (or all) of the functions below that
    are not yet implemented, please either contribute some code or *ask* me to do it and I'll try to oblige.
    
    Also unfortunately I had no time *yet* to write a *real* documentation; for now skim over the statements
    in test.lua for usage examples (they should be self-explanatory). You may also check the TokyoTyrant help
    (http://fallabs.com/tokyotyrant/spex.html).
    
    If you *really* need a manual then please yell (https://github.com/valeriupalos/lua-ttyrant/issues).
